description: Enforce presence of project_docs and standard AI documentation

1. Create directory `project_docs` in the workspace root if it doesn't exist.

2. Create `project_docs/agents.md` with the following content. If it already exists, verify it contains these rules:

   ```markdown
   # AI Agent Rulebook & Living Summary

   > **FOR ALL AI AGENTS:** Read this document FIRST before starting any task.

   ## 1. Living Project Summary

   ### 📂 Rule 1: Documentation Integrity
   *   **Location**: Always save plans, research, and diagrams in the `project_docs/` folder.
   *   **Visuals**: Generate and embed Mermaid diagrams for architecture or flow changes.
   *   **Format**: Use Markdown. Keep it clean and updated.

   ### 📝 Rule 2: Code Quality & Explanation
   *   **Comments**: Every function, class, and complex logic block MUST have clear, explanatory comments.
   *   **Why, Not just What**: Explain *why* a decision was made.
       *   *Bad*: "Sets timeout to 5000ms"
       *   *Good*: "Increased timeout to 5000ms to allow for slow legacy upstream service."
   *   **Standardized Documentation**: Use the standard documentation format for your language (e.g., Python Docstrings, C# XML Comments, JSDoc) to ensure automated tools (like Swagger) can parse it.

   ### 🛡️ Rule 3: Security & Best Practices
   *   **Priority 0**: Security is non-negotiable.
       *   NEVER commit secrets to git/artifacts (use `.env`).
       *   NEVER use plain-text passwords (hash them).
       *   NEVER allow unrestricted database access (use specific Schemas/Permissions).

   ### 🧠 Rule 4: Research First
   *   **Exhaustive Analysis**: Do not blindly write code. Research the problem, easy traps, and best practices first.
   *   **Planning**: Create or update `implementation_plan.md` *before* writing a single line of feature code.
   *   **Context**: Verify your assumptions by reading related files first.

   ### 📏 Rule 5: Naming Consistency
   *   **Database First**: The Database Schema is the Source of Truth.
   *   **Match Names**: API/JSON Field names MUST match the SQL Column names exactly.
       *   *Bad*: SQL=`PONumber` -> API=`po_number` (Requires error-prone mapping).
       *   *Good*: SQL=`PONumber` -> API=`PONumber` (Zero mapping required).

   *This document is a living artifact. Update the "Current State" section as you complete major milestones.*

3. Check if `project_docs/implementation_plan.md` exists. If not, create it with a basic template.

4. Check if `project_docs/architecture.md` exists. If not, create it with a basic header.
